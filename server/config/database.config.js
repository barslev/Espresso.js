 * Please be aware, If you want to use MongoDB,
 * Go to espresso.js and uncomment lines from 42 to 53.
 * 
 * Copy and paste the location for your local mongodb instance
 * 
 * Note: The reason we commented this lines on espresso.js file
 * was to allow the user without mongo to run the server.
 * 
 * Thanks!
